# Loss of Separation probability estimation for independant procedures
Application project of the [trajectory generation method using variational autoencoders](https://github.com/kruuZHAW/deep-traffic-generation). 

We calculate the loss of separation probability between STAR and SID procedures at Orly airport. By generating independantly arriving and departing trajectories, we assume that no air traffic controller ensure the proper separation distance aircraft. This study aims to estimate the risk of loss of separation if procedures were run independendently, and consequently, the contribution of air traffic control in the risk mitigation.
